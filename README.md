# Java-Basic-Projects
I publish my reel life based  basic java projects.


These are some java projects based real-life. I  write these codes while i study java language. 

project examples: simple countdown machine(for new year)
                  finding even numbers (in given number area)
                  calculating factoriel of a given number


📱 MyPhone Project: How It Works?
This project demonstrates the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Instead of writing everything in a single block, I separated the code into two parts:

The Template (features.java): This is the "blueprint" (like a C struct but smarter). It defines what a phone can do (methods like sentence and space).

The Object (myPhone.java): This is where the magic happens. I created a new instance (object) from the template using the new keyword.

The Logic: The main program sends specific data (Brand and GB) to the object's methods, which then process and display the phone's specifications on the console.


## 🎂 Birthday Organizer
A project that demonstrates **Advanced OOP Concepts** in Java.

### Key Features:
* **Constructor Chaining:** Uses `this()` to call one constructor from another, providing default values (like year: 2005, place: Tokat).
* **The `this` Keyword:** Distinguishes between class variables and parameters.
* **String Manipulation:** Uses `.toUpperCase()` to format the output.

### How to Run:
```bash
javac Birthday.java
java Birthday
